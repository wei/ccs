// CCS Bar - native macOS menu bar client for CCS.
//
// Build/test note: full Xcode (and therefore XCTest) is not required. The
// testable logic lives in the pure-Foundation `CCSBarCore` target and is
// exercised by the `ccs-bar-check` executable (an assert harness) so it runs
// on a CommandLineTools-only toolchain. The SwiftUI app target is added once
// the core is verified.

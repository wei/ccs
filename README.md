# CCS - Claude Code Switch

![CCS Logo](assets/ccs-logo-medium.png)

### The multi-provider profile and runtime manager for Claude Code and compatible CLIs

Run Claude, Codex, Droid-routed profiles, GLM, local models, and
Anthropic-compatible APIs without config thrash.

> **[Docker]** `ghcr.io/kaitranntt/ccs-dashboard:latest` is deprecated. Use `ghcr.io/kaitranntt/ccs:latest` instead. See [#1251](https://github.com/kaitranntt/ccs/issues/1251) and [docker/README.md](docker/README.md#choosing-an-image) for migration details.

## Why CCS

CCS gives you one stable command surface while letting you switch between:

- multiple runtimes such as Claude Code, Factory Droid, and Codex CLI
- multiple Claude subscriptions and isolated account contexts
- OAuth providers like Codex, Kiro, Claude, Qwen, Kimi, and more, with legacy
  Copilot compatibility for existing setups
- API and local-model profiles like GLM, Kimi, OpenRouter, Ollama, llama.cpp,
  Novita, and Alibaba Coding Plan

The goal is simple: stop rewriting config files, stop breaking active sessions,
and move between providers in seconds.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @kaitranntt/ccs
ccs config
```

Then launch whatever runtime fits the task:

```bash
ccs
ccs codex
ccs --target droid glm
ccs glm
ccs ollama
```

## OpenAI-Compatible Routing

CCS can now bridge Claude Code into OpenAI-compatible providers through a local
Anthropic-compatible proxy instead of requiring a native Anthropic upstream.

```bash
ccs api create --preset hf
ccs hf
```

Need to manage the proxy manually?

```bash
ccs proxy start hf
eval "$(ccs proxy activate)"
```

The proxy also supports request-time `profile:model` selectors, scenario-based
model routing through `proxy.routing`, and explicit activation helpers such as
`ccs proxy activate --fish`.

### Related Project: claude-code-router

[claude-code-router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) is an
excellent standalone tool for routing Claude Code requests to OpenAI-compatible
providers. CCS's local proxy and SSE transformation work was directly informed
by CCR's transformer architecture.

Use CCR when you want a standalone router without CCS profile management.
Use CCS when you want the routing flow integrated with CCS profiles, runtime
bridges, and the existing `ccs` command surface.

### Usage Analytics

![Analytics Dashboard](assets/screenshots/analytics.webp)

Track usage, costs, and session patterns across profiles. Deep dive:
[Dashboard Analytics](https://docs.ccs.kaitran.ca/features/dashboard/analytics).

### Live Auth And Health Monitoring

![Live Auth Monitor](assets/screenshots/live-auth-monitor.webp)

See auth state, account health, and provider readiness without dropping into raw
config. Deep dive:
[Live Auth Monitor](https://docs.ccs.kaitran.ca/features/dashboard/live-auth-monitor).

### OAuth Provider Control Center

![CLIProxy API](assets/screenshots/cliproxyapi.webp)

Manage OAuth-backed providers, quota visibility, and proxy-wide routing from one place. CCS now
surfaces round-robin vs fill-first natively in both CLI and dashboard flows instead of hiding that
choice inside raw upstream controls. The original CLIProxyAPI backend remains the default; the
community-maintained CLIProxyAPIPlus fork is opt-in for plus-only providers. When Plus is selected,
CCS points the embedded management panel at the maintained CPAMC dashboard fork by default.
Deep dive:
[CLIProxy API](https://docs.ccs.kaitran.ca/features/proxy/cliproxy-api).

### Managed Tooling And Fallbacks

![WebSearch Fallback](assets/screenshots/websearch.webp)

CCS can provision first-class local tools like WebSearch and image analysis for
third-party launches instead of leaving you to wire them by hand. Browser
automation now has a first-class setup path as well. Deep dive:

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Design with default Claude
ccs "design the auth flow"

# Implement with a different provider
ccs codex "implement the user service"

# Use a cheaper API profile for routine work
ccs glm "clean up tests and docs"

# Run a local model when you need privacy or offline access
ccs ollama "summarize these logs"
```
